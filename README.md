# Project Workflow Breakdown
1. Data Collection & Understanding
Explore the provided datasets from the reference materials.

Identify what business domain the data belongs to (sales, marketing, operations, etc.).

Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand patterns, trends, outliers, etc.

2. Data Preprocessing
Clean missing values, normalize data if required.

Segment data for indexing if using vector-based RAG pipelines.

Convert structured data into embeddings (e.g., using OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings in LangChain).

3. LLM Integration with RAG
Set up LangChain pipelines to enable:

Document indexing using vector stores like FAISS or Chroma.

Querying insights using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Use an LLM (OpenAI GPT-4, LLaMA, or similar) to interpret the retrieved documents and generate insights.

4. Insight Generation & Recommendation Engine
Based on queries like “What is the sales trend over the last 6 months?” or “Why is revenue declining?”, generate:

Textual insights (e.g., "Sales dropped in Q2 due to lower customer engagement").

Strategic recommendations (e.g., "Consider increasing marketing spend on Product X").

5. Visualization
Use libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or Seaborn to visualize:

Trends

KPIs

Forecasts

Optionally create a Streamlit or Dash interface for demo purposes.

6. Packaging
Build an interface (CLI/Web) where users can upload datasets and ask natural language questions.

Integrate visualization and response generation in the UI.

🔧 Tech Stack Suggestions
LangChain – Core framework for LLM + RAG.

Vector Store – FAISS, ChromaDB, or Pinecone.

LLMs – OpenAI, Cohere, or HuggingFace Transformers.

Visualization – Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit.

Optional Tools – Pandas Profiling, AutoML tools for initial insights.

💡 Sample Use Cases You Can Build:
Ask: “What were the top 3 reasons for customer churn last quarter?”

Ask: “Predict the revenue for next quarter based on current trends.”

Visualize: “Sales vs Marketing Spend over time.”

Recommend: “Suggest regions for expansion based on sales performance.”
